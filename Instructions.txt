Below are the commands needed to run before running the Main.java on ppc64le 

1.  Download the jdbc driver for RHEL 
Ex: wget https://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/Connector-J/mysql-connector-j-8.4.0-1.el9.noarch.rpm
    A rpm package with name mysql-connector-j-8.4.0-1.el9.noarch.rpm is downloaded 

2.  Install the downloaded jdbc driver 
Ex: sudo rpm -i mysql-connector-j-8.4.0-1.el9.noarch.rpm
    This command installs the mysql jdbc driver at location : /usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java.jar


3.  Copy the mysql-connector-java.jar file from /usr/share/java folder to your projects root 


4.  Compile the Main.java file 
Ex: javac -cp .:mysql-connector-java.jar Main.java
    This command creates a compiled bytecode file for you namely Main.class


5.  Run the Main.class file including the mysql-connector-java.jar file in classPath 
Ex: java -cp .:mysql-connector-java.jar Main 
    This command runs the java code written in Main.java file(which prints the list of tables present in the database)
